    <h1>Central Heating Installation – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How long does it take to install a central heating system?</h3>
      <p>
        The time it takes depends on the type of system and the size of the property. For a typical three-bedroom home, installation usually takes between 2 to 3 days. Our experienced engineers carry out as much pre-work as possible to keep your heating and hot water available for as long as we can during the installation process.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Will I need to move out during the installation?</h3>
      <p>
        No, there’s absolutely no need to leave your home while we carry out the work. At Phillips Maintenance & Plumbing, we aim to minimise disruption, keeping your heating and hot water running for as long as possible. We understand that life doesn’t stop, even during major home improvements.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How many engineers will complete the work?</h3>
      <p>
        It depends on the size and complexity of the job, but in most cases, we send two qualified engineers to carry out the installation efficiently and to a high standard.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you just install a radiator or replace a boiler?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely. No job is too big or small. Whether you need a single radiator, a replacement boiler, or a full central heating system, we’re happy to help.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Will I need to redecorate after installation?</h3>
      <p>
        Generally, no. We always aim to leave your home in excellent condition. If any drilling or minor disruption is required, we will "make good" the affected areas. Any potential impact will be discussed with you upfront during the quotation process, and we’ll carry out the necessary remedial work.
      </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do you offer a warranty on your work?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, we do. All details of the warranty will be clearly outlined in your quotation, giving you peace of mind that our work is protected and guaranteed.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can you maintain my new central heating system?</h3>
      <p>
        Definitely. We offer ongoing servicing and maintenance for both newly installed and existing central heating systems. We’ll help you keep your system running efficiently year-round.
